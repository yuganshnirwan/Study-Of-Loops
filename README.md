# Study-Of-Loops
Aim
To understand and implement the working of for and while loops in Python programming.

Objectives
To learn the concept of repeated (iterative) execution
To create and execute loops for basic iteration
To apply loop control statements such as break and continue
To differentiate between sequence-based and condition-based loops
Theory
Looping is a control structure in programming that enables a block of code to run multiple times, either for a fixed number of iterations or until a specified condition becomes false. Python mainly provides two looping constructs:

for loop
while loop
1. For Loop
The for loop in Python is used to iterate over elements of a sequence such as a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string. It automatically traverses through each item in the collection and executes a block of statements for every element.

It is most suitable when the number of iterations is already known or when working directly with iterable objects.

2. While Loop
The while loop executes a block of code repeatedly as long as a given condition evaluates to True. This loop is generally used when the total number of iterations is not predetermined and depends on a logical condition.

The loop must include a condition update inside it to prevent infinite execution.

Difference Between For Loop and While Loop
A for loop is preferred when the number of iterations is known in advance.
A while loop is used when execution depends on a condition.
The for loop automatically handles iteration over sequences.
The while loop requires manual updating of loop variables.
Features of Loops
Iterative Execution – Repeats code blocks to process data efficiently.
Controlled Flow – Directs execution based on defined conditions.
Reduced Redundancy – Eliminates repetitive code writing.
Automation – Commonly used in mathematical computations and data processing tasks.
Break Statement
The break statement is used to immediately terminate a loop.
When encountered, the loop stops executing and control moves to the statement following the loop.
It is often combined with an if condition.

Continue Statement
The continue statement skips the remaining code in the current iteration and proceeds directly to the next iteration of the loop.
Unlike break, it does not terminate the loop entirely.

Applications of Loops
Processing student or database records
Accessing configuration data
Removing duplicates or filtering collections
Performing repetitive calculations
Automating data-related tasks
Algorithms
1. Factorial of a Number
Start

Initialize i = 1 and fac = 1
Input the number n
While i <= n
Multiply fac = fac * i
Increment i by 1
Display the value of fac
Stop

2. Reverse a Number
Start

Input the number a
Initialize rev = 0
While a > 0
dig = a % 10
rev = (rev * 10) + dig
a = a // 10
Display rev
Stop

3. Count Digits in a Number
Start

Input the number n
Initialize count = 0
While n > 0
Increment count
Remove last digit using n //= 10
Display count
Stop

4. Armstrong Number Check
Start

Input number N as a string
Initialize total = 0
For each character in N
Convert it to integer
Raise it to the power of length of N
Add result to total
If total equals integer value of N
Print "It is an Armstrong Number"
Else
Print "It is not an Armstrong Number"
Stop

5. All Possible Combinations of 3 Digits
Start

Input a three-digit number N
Extract digits into a list d
Use three nested loops (i, j, k from 0 to 2)
Check that i, j, and k are all different
Print d[i], d[j], d[k]
Stop

Conclusion
Loops are essential programming tools that help execute repetitive tasks efficiently.
The for loop is best suited for working with sequences, while the while loop is ideal for condition-based execution.
By using control statements like break and continue, programmers can precisely manage loop execution, making loops highly useful in real-world applications.
